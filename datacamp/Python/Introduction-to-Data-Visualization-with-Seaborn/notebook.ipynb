Create differentiating lines for each country of origin (`origin`). \n- Create a box plot from `student_data` to explore the relationship between the number of failures (`failures`) and the average final grade (`G3`).\n- Create a bar plot from `survey` to compare how `Loneliness` differs across values for `Internet usage`.
