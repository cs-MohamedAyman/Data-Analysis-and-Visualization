Plot Seattle's and Austin's `MLY-TAVG-NORMAL` (for average temperature) in the top Axes and plot their `MLY-PRCP-NORMAL` (for average precipitation) in the bottom axes. The cities should have different colors and the line style should be different between precipitation and temperature. Make sure to label your viz!\n- Using `climate_change`, create a twin Axes object with the shared x-axis as time. There should be two lines of different colors not sharing a y-axis: `co2` and `relative_temp`. Only include dates from the 2000s and annotate the first date at which `co2` exceeded 400.\n- Create a scatter plot from `medals` comparing the number of Gold medals vs the number of Silver medals with each point labeled with the country name.\n- Explore if the distribution of `Age` varies in different sports by creating histograms from `summer_2016`. \n- Try out [the different Matplotlib styles available](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html) and save your visualizations as a PNG file.","metadata":{},"id":"b3317e25-17e0-4f71-89fb-18d950b5bd85","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.7"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
